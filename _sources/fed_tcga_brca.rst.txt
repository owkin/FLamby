Fed-TCGA-BRCA
=============

The dataset used in this repo comes from `The Cancer Genome Atlas
(TCGA) <https://www.cancer.gov/about-nci/organization/ccg/research/structural-genomics/tcga>`__
from `the GDC data portal <https://portal.gdc.cancer.gov/>`__.

We selected one single cancer type: Breast Invasive Carcinoma (BRCA) and
only use clinical tabular data. We replicate the preprocessing used by
`Andreux et al. <https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.08997.pdf>`__ from data
originally computed from TCGA by `Liu et
al. <https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29625055/>`__:

i.e. a subset of the features in the raw TCGA-BRCA dataset (categorical
variables are one-hot encoded).

Terms of use

Note that we only use unrestricted data. We do not guarantee that the
use of this data can be done freely by the user. As such it is mandatory
that one should check the applicability of the licence associated with
this data before using it.

In particular, as per the `GDC data access
policy <https://gdc.cancer.gov/about-gdc/gdc-policies>`__, users should
> not attempt to identify individual human research participants from
whom the data were obtained.

Ethics
------

As per the `TCGA
policies <https://www.cancer.gov/about-nci/organization/ccg/research/structural-genomics/tcga/history/policies>`__,
special care was devoted to ensure privacy protection of research
subjects, including but not limited to HIPAA compliance. Note that we do
not use the genetic part of TCGA whose access is restricted due to its
sensitivity.

In particular, as per the `GDC data access

Data
----

Preprocessed data is stored in this repo in the file ``brca.csv``, so
the dataset does not need to be downloaded. The medical centers (with
their geographic regions) are stored in the file ``centers.csv``. From
this file and the patients' TCGA barcodes, we can extract the region of
origin of each patient's tissue sort site (TSS). The numbers of sites
being too large (64) we regroup them in 6 different regions (Northeast,
South, West, Midwest, Europe, Canada). The patients' stratified split by
region is static and stored in the train\_test\_split.csv file.

Downloading and preprocessing
-----------------------------
This dataset is the only one that doesn't need to be downloaded as it is
already included in FLamby.


Using the dataset
-----------------

Now that the dataset is ready for use you can load it using the low or
high-level API by doing:

.. code:: python

    from flamby.datasets.fed_tcga_brca import FedTcgaBrca

    # To load the first center as a pytorch dataset
    center0 = FedTcgaBrca(center=0, train=True)
    # To load the second center as a pytorch dataset
    center1 = FedTcgaBrca(center=1, train=True)
    # To sample batches from each of the local datasets use the traditional pytorch API
    from torch.utils.data import DataLoader as dl

    X, y = iter(dl(center0, batch_size=16, shuffle=True, num_workers=0)).next()

More informations on how to train model and handle flamby datasets in
general are available in the :any:`quickstart`

Baseline training and evaluation in a pooled setting
----------------------------------------------------

To train and evaluate a model for the pooled dataset, run:

::

    python benchmark.py --GPU 0 --workers 4
