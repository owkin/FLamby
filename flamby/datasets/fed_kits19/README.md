## KiTS19

KiTS19 dataset is an open access Kidney Tumor Segmentation dataset that was made public in 2019 for a segmentation Challenge.
We use the official KiTS19 repository (https://github.com/neheller/kits19) to download the dataset. 

## Dataset Description

|                   | Dataset description 
| ----------------- | -----------------------------------------------
| Description       | This is the dataset from KiTS19 Challenge.
| Dataset           | 210 CT scans with segmentation masks as Train Data and 90 CT scans with no segmentations as Test Data. Since Test data does not have ground truth segmetation masks, we canot use it for training/testing. Therefore, we will use only 210 CT scans in our exploration of this dataset. 
| Centers           | Data comes from 87 different centers. The sites information can be found in fed_kits19/dataset_creation_scripts/anony_sites.csv file.
| Task              | Supervised Segmentation



## Data Download instructions
The commands for data download
(as also mentioned on the official kits19 git repository (https://github.com/neheller/kits19)) are as follows,

1. Clone the kits19 git repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/neheller/kits19
```

2. Follow the following commands to download the dataset. Make sure you have ~30GB space available.
```bash
cd kits19
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
python3 -m starter_code.get_imaging
```
These commands will download the KiTS19 dataset in your download directory. 

3. Move the downloaded dataset to the data directory you want to keep it in and save
the path in the data_directory.yaml file present in the flamby/datasets/fed_kits19/dataset_creation_scripts folder.
   
4. For preprocessing, we rely on nnunet library as it is considered a benchmark for this dataset. {Side fact: The team won the KiTS19 challenge.} Any changes made to this library are explicity mentioned as changed in comments. 
   This requires installation of nnunet package,
   ```bash
   pip3 install nnunet
   ```
   also  batchgenerators for augmentations,
   ```bash
   pip install --upgrade batchgenerators
   ```
   
5. To run preprocessing, first step is dataset conversion, from fed_kits19 directory
```bash
cd dataset_creation_scripts/nnunet/dataset_conversion
```
and run the following command to preprocess a small chunk of data, 
```bash
python3 Task064_KiTS_labelsFixed.py --debug True 
```
if you want complete data to be preprocessed, set debug argument to be False as follows,
```bash
python3 Task064_KiTS_labelsFixed.py --debug False
```

After data conversion, run the preprocessing, from fed_kits19 directory
```bash
cd dataset_creation_scripts/nnunet/experiment_planning
```
For debug mode, it can take ~
