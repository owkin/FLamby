## FeTS 2021


Federated Tumor segmentation Challenge (FeTS) 2021 focuses on Brain Tumor Segmentation task. It essentially provides Brain Tumor Segmentation Challenge (BraTS) data with the source 
information. Detailed description on how to download the data has been provided below.

## Dataset description

|                   | Dataset description 
| ----------------- | -----------------------------------------------
| Description       | This is the dataset from BraTS Challenge 2020 data and some other real world institution.
| Dataset           | 369 patients data with segmentation labels provided.
| Centers           | This comes from 17 medical institutes. The institutes IDs are provided in the Training data folder in a file named **_partitioning_1.csv_**.

## Download instructions

In order to request the FeTS 2021 data, follow the following steps.

Step 1: Create an account in CBICA's Image Processing Portal (https://ipp.cbica.upenn.edu/) and wait for its approval.

Step 2. Login to your CBICA's Image Processing Portal account at (https://ipp.cbica.upenn.edu/) and click on the 'FeTS'21: Registration and Data Request' under MICCAI FeTS 2021 (Challenge on Federated Learning). This will open up an application, fill in the details and submit the application. (Make sure to add your team name as a single word). Wait for the application to get approved.

Step 3. Once it gets approved, there will be a results/***.zip file. Download this file as it will contain links to the Google drive you can download your data from. Download this data and paste it in the directory you want.

The whole process may take 20-30 minutes.
