Fed-Camelyon16
==============

Camelyon16 as Camelyon17 are open access (CC0), the original dataset is
accessible `here <https://camelyon17.grand-challenge.org/Data/>`__. We
will first fetch the slides from the public Google Drive, and will then
tile the matter using a feature extractor, producing a bag of features
for each slide.

Introduction
~~~~~~~~~~~~

The dataset is hosted on a `several
mirrors <https://camelyon17.grand-challenge.org/Data/>`__ (GigaScience,
Google Drive, Baidu Pan). We provide below some scripts to automatically
download the dataset based on the Google Drive API, which requires a
Google Account. If you do not have a Google account, you can
alternatively download manually the dataset through one of the mirrors.
You will find below detailed instructions for each method. In both
cases, make sure you have enough space to store the raw dataset
(~900GB).

Method A: Automatic download with the Google Drive API
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In order to use the Google Drive API you need to have a google account
and to access the `google developpers
console <https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials/consent?authuser=1>`__
in order to get a json containing an OAuth2.0 secret.

All steps necessary to obtain the JSON are described in numerous places
in the internet such as in pydrive's
`quickstart <https://pythonhosted.org/PyDrive/quickstart.html>`__, or in
this `very nice tutorial's first 5
minutes <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1y0-IfRW114>`__ on Youtube. It
should not take more than 5 minutes. The important steps are listed
below.

Step 1: Setting up Google App and associated secret
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

1. Create a project in `Google
   console <https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials/consent?authuser=1>`__.
   For instance, you can call it ``flamby``.
2. Go to Oauth2 consent screen (on the left of the webpage), choose a
   name for your app and publish it for external use.
3. Go to Credentials, create an id, then client oauth id
4. Choose Web app, go through the steps and **allow URI redirect**
   towards ``http://localhost:6006`` and ``http://localhost:6006/`` (notice the
   last backslash)
5. Retrieve the secrets in JSON by clicking on Download icon at the end
   of the process.
6. Enable Google Drive API for this project, by clicking on "API and
   services" on the left panel

Then copy-paste your secrets to the directory you want:

.. code:: bash

    cp ~/Downloads/code_secret_client_bignumber.apps.googleusercontent.com.json client_secrets.json

Step 2: Downloading the dataset
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  **Remark 1: If you are downloading on a remote server**, make sure
   you do ssh forwarding of the port 6006 onto the port 6006 of your
   laptop.
-  Remark 2 : Make sure you have enough space to hold the dataset
   (900GB).
-  First cd into the ``dataset_creation_scripts`` folder:

   .. code:: bash

       cd flamby/datasets/fed_camelyon16/dataset_creation_scripts

Then run:

.. code:: bash

    python download.py --output-folder ./camelyon16_dataset --path-to-secret /path/towards/client_secrets.json --port 6006

The first time this script is launched, the user will be asked to
explicitly allow the app to operate by logging into his/her Google
account (hence the need for the port 6006 forwarding in the case of a
remote machine without browser).

This script will download all of Camelyon's slides in the output folder.
As there are multiple slides that are quite big, this script can take a
few hours to complete. It can be stopped and resumed anytime however if
you are ssh into a server better use detached mode (screenrc/tmux/etc.).

**IMPORTANT :** If you choose to relocate the dataset after downloading
it, it is imperative that you run the following script otherwise all
subsequent scripts will not find it:

::

    python update_config.py --new-path /new/path/towards/dataset #adding --debug if you are in debug mode

Method B: Manual download from the official mirrors
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We are interested in the Camelyon16 portion of the `Camelyon
dataset <https://camelyon17.grand-challenge.org/Data/>`__. In the
following, we will detail the steps to manually download the dataset
from the Google Drive repository. You can easily adapt the steps to the
other mirrors.

Camelyon16 is stored on a public `Google
Drive <https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0BzsdkU4jWx9Bb19WNndQTlUwb2M?resourcekey=0-FREBAxB4QK4bt9Zch_g5Mg>`__.
The dataset is pre-split into training and testing slides. The training
slides are further divided into 2 folders: normal and tumor. Download
all the ``.tif`` files in the
`normal <https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0BzsdkU4jWx9BNUFqRE81QS04eDg?resourcekey=0-p6LFOzRfCTfyi_JpshhoTQ>`__,
`tumor <https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0BzsdkU4jWx9BUzVXeUg0dUNOR1U?resourcekey=0-dODmENBQPCw06DITRJfnfg>`__
and `testing
images <https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0BzsdkU4jWx9BWk11WEtZZUNFY0U?resourcekey=0-U0E7SyHPJeQd77VAi3z15Q>`__
folders. Put all the resulting files into a single folder. You should
end up with 399 ``.tif`` files in a given folder ``PATH-TO-FOLDER``.

The last step consists in creating a metadata file that will be used by
the preprocessing step. Create a file name ``dataset_location.yaml``
under ``flamby/datasets/fed_camelyon16/dataset_creation_scripts/`` with
the following content:

.. code:: yaml

    dataset_path: PATH-TO-FOLDER
    download_complete: true

The download is now complete. ## Dataset preprocessing (tile extraction)

The next step is to tile the matter on each slide with a feature
extractor pretrained on IMAGENET.

We will use the `histolab
package <https://github.com/histolab/histolab>`__ to segment the matter
on each slide and torchvision to download a pretrained ResNet50 that
will be applied on each tile to convert each slide to a bag of numpy
features. This package requires the installation of
`Openslide <https://openslide.org/download/>`__. The associated webpage
contains instructions to install it on every major distributions. On
Linux simply run:

.. code:: python

    sudo apt-get install openslide-tools

One can choose to remove or not the original slides that take up quite
some space to keep only the features (therefore using only
approximatively 50GB instead of 800GB).

As extracting the matter on all the slides is a lengthy process this
script might take a few hours (and a few days if the tiling is done from
scratch). It can also be stopped and resumed anytime and should be
preferably run in detached mode. This process should be run on an
environment with GPU, otherwise it might be prohibitively slow.

.. code:: bash

    python tiling_slides.py --batch-size 64

or

.. code:: bash

    python tiling_slides.py --batch-size 64 --remove-big-tiff

Using the dataset
-----------------

Now that the dataset is ready for use you can load it using the low or
high-level API by running in a python shell:

.. code:: python

    from flamby.datasets.fed_camelyon16 import FedCamelyon16, Camelyon16Raw

    # To load the first center as a pytorch dataset
    center0 = FedCamelyon16(center=0, train=True)
    # To load the second center as a pytorch dataset
    center1 = FedCamelyon16(center=1, train=True)

    # To sample batches from each of the local datasets use the traditional pytorch API
    from torch.utils.data import DataLoader as dl
    # For this specific dataset samples do not have the same size and therefore batching requires padding implemented in collate_fn
    from flamby.datasets.fed_camelyon16 import collate_fn

    X, y = iter(dl(center0, batch_size=16, shuffle=True, num_workers=0, collate_fn=collate_fn)).next()

More informations on how to train model and handle flamby datasets in
general are available in the :any:`quickstart`.

Benchmarking the baseline in a pooled setting
---------------------------------------------

In order to benchmark the baseline on the pooled dataset one needs to
download and preprocess the dataset and launch the following script:

.. code:: bash

    python benchmark.py --log --num-workers-torch 10

This will launch 5 single-centric runs and store log results for
training in ./runs/seed42-47 and testing in ./runs/tests-seed42-47. The
command:

.. code:: bash

    tensorboard --logdir=./runs

can then be used to visualize results (use `port forwarding if
necessary <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/37987839/how-can-i-run-tensorboard-on-a-remote-server>`__).
