Fed-Heart Disease
=================

The Heart Disease dataset [1] was collected in 1988 in four centers:
Cleveland, Hungary, Switzerland and Long Beach V. We do not own the

Ethics
~~~~~~

As per the `dataset
website <https://archive-beta.ics.uci.edu/dataset/45/heart+disease>`__,
sensitive entries of the dataset were removed by the original authors:

    The names and social security numbers of the patients were recently
    removed from the database, replaced with dummy values.

Download and preprocessing instructions
---------------------------------------

To download the data, First cd into the ``dataset_creation_scripts``
folder:

.. code:: bash

    cd flamby/datasets/fed_heart_disease/dataset_creation_scripts

then simply run the following command:

::

    python download.py --output-folder ./heart_disease_dataset

This will download 38.6ko of data.

**IMPORTANT :** If you choose to relocate the dataset after downloading
it, it is imperative that you run the following script otherwise all
subsequent scripts will not find it:

::

    python update_config.py --new-path /new/path/towards/dataset

Using the dataset
-----------------

Now that the dataset is ready for use you can load it using the low or
high-level API by doing:

.. code:: python

    from flamby.datasets.fed_heart_disease import FedHeartDisease, HeartDiseaseRaw

    # To load the first center as a pytorch dataset
    center0 = FedHeartDisease(center=0, train=True)
    # To load the second center as a pytorch dataset
    center1 = FedHeartDisease(center=1, train=True)
    # To sample batches from each of the local datasets use the traditional pytorch API
    from torch.utils.data import DataLoader as dl

    X, y = iter(dl(center0, batch_size=16, shuffle=True, num_workers=0)).next()

More informations on how to train model and handle flamby datasets in
general are available in the :any:`quickstart`

Benchmarking the baseline on a pooled setting
---------------------------------------------

In order to benchmark the baseline on the pooled dataset one need to
download and preprocess the dataset and launch the following script:

::

    python benchmark.py

This will train a logistic regression classifier (which is the strongest
baseline according to `UCI ML
Repository <https://archive-beta.ics.uci.edu/dataset/45/heart+disease>`__.
